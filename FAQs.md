## Where are your offices?
Porto (Portugal) and Berlin (Germany). 

## How is life in Porto?
Terrific. 

## How is life in Berlin?
Swell. 

## Do you have remote positions? 
For now, we don't. However, we do have a liberal work-from-home policy.

## What is a "liberal work-from-home policy"?
At dashdash, we consider facetime super important, and we prefer if people sit together. At times you may need to stay home for personal reasons, or you may prefer to work from somewhere else. We are cool with that, as long as you are still available for planned meetings! 

## Do you accept international candidates?
We do. Be aware that getting VISAs to come and work in the EU may take a long time. But we like everyone!

## What do you mean by "unlimited vacation"?
We mean that you should rest whenever you need to. Everyone in the company get a number of paid vacation days (determined by country laws). On top of this, we give you a permission to leave for (unpaid) vacation days. 

## Do you have an On-Call Support schedule?
Yes, we do. All of our Engineers are entitled to be part of the on-call support schedule, which means one of them per week is first line of contact if any incident happens within our product.

Of value this on-call time and so engineers receive â‚¬200 per on-call week just to be scheduled for on-call, even if no incident happens. If an incident happens during non-working hours, we pay engineers their hourly wage plus an extra amount for the time worked. The extra is based on Portuguese law.

## Do you provide any health insurance?
Yes, all dashdashers are included in our health plan, so they enjoy a premium healthcare service at a low price. Besides, we know how important their family is for them, so we also include spouses and children in our health insurance plan, without any cost. Our plan is the Multicare 3 health plan.
