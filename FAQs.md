## Where are your offices?
Porto (Portugal) and Berlin (Germany). 

## How is life in Porto?
Terrific. 

## How is life in Berlin?
Swell. 

## Do you have remote positions? 
For now, we don't. However, we do have a liberal work-from-home policy.

## What is a "liberal work-from-home policy"?
At dashdash, we consider facetime super important, and we prefer if people sit together. At times you may need to stay home for personal reasons, or you may feel the need to work from somewhere else. We are cool with that, as long as you are still available for planned meetings!

## Do you provide health insurance?
Yes. Our policy covers employees and their direct family. It works differently in Portugal and Germany.

## Do you accept international candidates?
We do. Be aware that getting VISAs to come and work in the EU may take a long time. But we like everyone!

## What do you mean by "unlimited vacation"?
We mean that you should rest whenever you need to. Everyone in the company get a number of paid vacation days (determined by country laws). On top of this, we give you a permission to leave for (unpaid) vacation days.
