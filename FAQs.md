## Where are your offices?
Porto (Portugal) and Berlin (Germany). 

## How is life in Porto?
Terrific. 

## How is life in Berlin?
Swell. 

## Do you have remote positions? 
For now, we don't. However, we do have a liberal work-from-home policy.

## Do you provide health insurance?
Yes. Our policy covers employees and their direct family. It works differently in Portugal and Germany.

## Do you accept international candidates?
We do. Be aware that getting VISAs to come and work in the EU may take a long time. But we like everyone!
