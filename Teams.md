At Rows, teams enjoy a lot of ownership.
- For example, decisions inside Product teams are taken by the local Product Manager, Engineering Manager (Engineers) and Design lead as a group.
- We see Functions as the providers of technical guidance. They are excellence centers from which recommendations and technical feedback originates.
