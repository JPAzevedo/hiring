# Intro
Imagine a spreadsheet grid where each cell can also call an API or repeat a job. This is what we are building. Our product lets users create interactive web apps using the spreadsheet skills they already have. You can check us at [dashdash.com](http://dashdash.com).

We have also been on the news. You can find us on TechCrunch (https://tcrn.ch/2LnB1r0), VentureBeat (https://bit.ly/2IGwgHS), Observador [pt] (https://bit.ly/2rZV0Ar) and many other media!
