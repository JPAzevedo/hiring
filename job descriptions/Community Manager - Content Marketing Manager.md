## Community Manager / Content Marketing Manager
# Intro
At dashdash we create tools that make computation accessible to everyone.
Coding used to be hard. dashdash changes that. We want you to create interactive web apps using the spreadsheet skills that you already have. Imagine a grid where each cell can exchange data with other online services or repeat a job. This is what we’re building.

[dashdash](https://dashdash.com/) is a well-funded startup with top investors like Accel and Cherry Ventures. We have offices in Berlin and Porto. Check us e.g. on [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dashdash), [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/dashdash-a-platform-to-create-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills-nabs-8m-led-by-accel/), [Venturebeat](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/16/accel-leads-8-million-investment-in-dashdash-to-create-web-apps-from-spreadsheets/).
