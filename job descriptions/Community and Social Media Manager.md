## Intro
At Rows we create tools that make computation accessible to everyone.
Coding used to be hard. Rows changes that. We want to empower the world's 1 billion spreadsheet users to build the tools they need to get their job done themselves, with the skills they already have. Imagine a grid where each cell can exchange data with other online services, repeat a job, or turn your spreadsheet into a web app in one click. This is what we’re building.

[Rows](https://rows.com/), formerly dashdash, is a well-funded startup with top investors like Accel and Cherry Ventures. We have offices in Berlin and Porto.
