# What is DashDash?
Imagine a spreadsheet grid where each cell can also call an API or repeat a job. This is what we are building. Our product lets users create interactive web apps using the spreadsheet skills they already have. You can check us at dashdash.com.

We have also been on the news. You can find us on TechCrunch (https://tcrn.ch/2LnB1r0), VentureBeat (https://bit.ly/2IGwgHS), Observador [pt] (https://bit.ly/2rZV0Ar) and many other media!
