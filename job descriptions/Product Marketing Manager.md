# Intro

At Rows we create tools that make computation accessible to everyone. Coding used to be hard. Rows changes that. 
We want you to create interactive web apps using the spreadsheet skills that you already have. Imagine a grid where each cell can exchange data with other online services or repeat a job. 
Where users can turn their spreadsheets into mobile-responsive web apps as forms or reports in one click. This is what weâ€™re building.

Rows is a well-funded startup with top investors like Accel, Lakestar and Cherry Ventures. 
We are a team of 50 who want to empower business people to take their life into their own hands again and build the tools they need for their jobs themselves. 
We have offices in Berlin - a business team of 5 - and Porto - a tech team of 50. Check us e.g. on TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Business Insider (DE) and many other media!

# Your responsibilities

Your role is to team up with our Growth team to work on projects with the mission of improving our user activation and retention.

Your focus will be accelerating the "ahah moment" for everyone that sign-ups at Rows. This means identifying the right use cases, optimizing the user onboarding, and build content (templates, other user education content) to help people "get it" and be successful.   
 
Your two KPIs will be: user activation and week 1 user retention. 
 
## What you'll do

* Devise, implement and own the user journey from sign-up to activation.
* Partner closely with Comms, Customer success, and our Data team to analyze and identify what traits, product experience and other factors make users stick.
* Work with our Growth Engineering team on user onboarding, product announcements, and other features that accelerate "ahah moment".
* Research and document new user personas and use cases to pursue.
* Deeply understand, research, and segment our users to deliver customized experiences to the right audience.
* Build spreadsheet templates and other artifacts (e.g how-to-guides, blogposts) to complement the user onboarding.
* Maintain a rigorous and organized view of the projects and results we are achieving across our customer base.
